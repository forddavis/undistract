Basic chrome extension for blocking annoying YouTube suggestions and Intercom popups

Undistract aims to make your web usage more productive and professional by hiding distracting / NSFW content and suggestions. You know what you're looking for and don't need to be bombarded with suggestions.

Undistract hides:
- All content on the YouTube home page except for navigation/search
- Suggested videos on the YouTube sidebar
- Suggestions while typing on both YouTube and Google (*note this does not interfere with nav-bar searches)
- Notifications/Chat popups from Intercom on various websites

You can turn off Undistract on a page by clicking its icon.
